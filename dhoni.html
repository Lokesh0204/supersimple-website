            The beach was surrounded by dense trees and it was very clean. My mother sat on the sand under a tree and took out a book to read. My sister and I went to play with the water in the sea. We splashed water on each other and enjoyed the sea waves when they made us go up and down. After some time, we came backThen I and my sister made a sandcastle. I also collected shells on the beach and we decorated the castle with them.

            We bought fruits on the beach and also drank coconut water after that. When it was evening, we saw the setting sun. It looked like the sun was going inside the sea. We took a lot of pictures of this scene.</font>
