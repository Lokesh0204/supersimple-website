        But it is Miami and Major League Soccer where Messi will continue his work, with a box-office hit from the player himself in a joint interview with Mundo Deportivo and SPORT confirming he will be heading to Florida to continue his career.“I decided to go to Miami,” Messi said. “I still haven’t closed it one hundred percent. I’m missing some things, but we decided to continue the journey."
        
        Inter Miami quickly followed up the publication of Messi’s interview in Spain with their own video, poking fun at reports in recent months skeptical of MLS and linking him with Barcelona or a move to the Saudi Pro League.
        
        Earlier on Wednesday that MLS and Inter Miami sensed there was an opportunity to pry Messi away from Barcelona, ​​largely because of a financial package that included payments from the league’s biggest business partners in Apple and adidas.
        
        It will be the first time Messi has played senior football outside of Europe, having enjoyed 17 years in the Barcelona first team before leaving for Paris Saint-Germain – where he won Ligue 1 in two
